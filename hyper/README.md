# Word Shuffle

## Description

Loop through array of words to display them as a shuffle effect

## About

Inspired by a word shuffle tutorial (link below) I wanted to extend the code to be able to loop through a given string of comma separated words which are defined in a data attribute.

The JavaScript reads retrieves the words and converts them into an array. The code then iterates through each word and writes them out in a shuffling effect using random letters which progressively convert into the new word.

I also added in the option to use the previous word as the base for the effect rather than using random letters. This can be defined via a data attribute and defaults to random.
