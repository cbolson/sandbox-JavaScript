## About

- A simple JavaScript countdown but I wanted to experiment with the resulting output by displaying the time values as a circular chart.
- I used SVG circles and CSS custom properties to define radius, colors and percentage progress.
- The JavaScript updates the "percentage" property after each second count.
- As an added bonus I added a date selector and Local Storage to save the date.
