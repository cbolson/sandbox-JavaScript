# Animated circular Nav/Cards

## Description

CSS only animated nav (desktop only as it requires :hover)

## About

- Navigation or product selector which animates out on mouseover.
- 100% CSS animations (I used SASS just to simplify the calculations).
- Hamburger menu - when you mouseover the nav options animate out around the center circle.
- Hover over each nav option to reveal it's title and main image in the center.
- Added a second version with thumbnails replace with texts and changed transparency to see the animation effect on hover.
